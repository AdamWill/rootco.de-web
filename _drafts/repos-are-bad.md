Tumbleweed - **"In order to change some things quickly while staying reliable, you must be able to change ALL things quickly."**

SLE - **"In order to preserve stability, you must change as little as possible."**

Fact - **"Changing software stacks while maintaining a static base system can only be achieved at either the cost of stability, reliability, or by accepting a slower pace of change."**

Leap - **"In order to find balance between stability, reliability, and pace of change, you must change little or nothing during a minor release. In new minor releases, small to moderate changes should be considered, while preserving users expectations of functionality. Major change should be reserved for new major version releases."**

Modules - **"Narrowly defined software stacks that do not overlap other software or operating system componants, can move at a moderately faster pace, assuming they do not require change elsewhere in the operating system."**
